      Apple is the common name for any tree of the genus Malus, of 
      the family Rosaceae. Apple trees grow in any of the temperate 
      areas of the world. Some apple blossoms are white, but most
      have stripes or tints of rose. Some apple blossoms are bright
      red. Apples have a firm and fleshy structure that grows from
      the blossom. The colors of apples range from green to very 
      dark red. The wood of apple trees is fine grained and hard. 
      It is, therefore, good for furniture construction. Apple trees
      have been grown for many centuries. They are propagated by
      grafting because they do not reproduce themselves.
