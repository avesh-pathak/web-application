    <p>The formula is: <b>(a + b)<sup>2</sup></b></p>
    <p>Where a and b are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle.</p>
    <p>To find the area of the rectangle, we multiply the length of the diagonal by the length of the base.</p>
    <p>The formula for the area of a rectangle is: <b>base x height</b></p>
    <p>To find the length of the diagonal, we add the length of the sides together.</p>
    <p>The formula for the length of the diagonal is: <b>sqrt(a^2 + b^2)</b></p>
    <p>To find the length of the base, we subtract the length of the height from the length of the diagonal.</p>
    <p>The formula for the length of the base is: <b>sqrt(a^2 + b^2 - height^2)</b></p>
